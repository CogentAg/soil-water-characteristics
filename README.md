`saxton_rawls` is a function to calculate Bulk Density, 

The Saxton and Rawls model estimates key soil water characteristics, such as water potential, water-holding capacity, and hydraulic conductivity. It does this based on more readily available soil properties, such as texture and organic matter, which avoids the need for costly and time-consuming field measurements. 

The model provides estimates for several important soil water properties:

- Water content at saturation: The maximum amount of water a soil can hold when all pore spaces are filled.
- Field capacity (FC): The amount of soil water remaining after excess water has drained away. The Saxton and Rawls model provides reasonably good estimates for this value.
- Permanent wilting point (PWP): The water content below which a plant can no longer extract water from the soil, causing it to wilt. The model also provides reasonably good estimates for this.
- Available water-holding capacity: The volume of water held in the soil between field capacity and the permanent wilting point that is available for plants to use.
- Hydraulic conductivity: The rate at which water moves through the soil. 

The model relies on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil database and was updated by Saxton and Rawls in 2006 to improve its accuracy.

In addition to texture and organic matter, the updated version also accounts for bulk density, gravel, and salinity.
